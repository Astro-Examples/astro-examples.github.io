# Yale Astronomy Software Workshop Series

Computing and Software development is an integral part of astronomical research. While some elements of this, such as programming languages, are sometimes taught in the classroom, there are many soft-skills, tools, and resources that can improve one's efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility (i.e., quality of life) as a researcher. These tools and skills are often stumbled upon heterogeneously, or passed between individuals. 

The Software Workshop Series aims to discuss these topics, presenting minimal working examples and demonstrations. Each week, we'll cover a topic useful either directly to research coding or to being a scientist and science communicator. Examples include:

- optimal workflows, command line tools
- speeding up code
- building websites (including with interactive code elements)
- sphinx/autoapi/documenting and packaging code for distribution 
- tips/tricks for working on remote servers
- Github, github actions, etc.
- matplotlib tricks

ad more. 

Each week, we will have 1-2 presenters who've agreed to give a more formal overview / examples of the topic at hand --- but everyone is invited to share their knowledge with one another along the way. All materials generated through this series will be open source and available here on github. 

## Schedule
Below is a tenative schedule of topics based on user input. 

|Date | Session Description | 
|:---:|:-------------------:|
|September 20| Continuous Integration / Github Actions / Show your Work!|
|October 4| Speeding up Python with numba and jax |
|October 14 (FRI)| Web Stuff (markdown->websites,pyscript (python online), etc) Note the special day, due to holiday the following week. |
| November 1 | Python Software Development (unit testing, packaging, sphinx)| 
| November 15 | ML in python / pyTorch | 
| December 6 |TBD|




## Session 1: Workflows
### 2022-08-23

Presenters: Joel Ong, Juan Guerra

In this session we discussed the goals of the series and invited discussion on the topics we should cover that would be most useful. Then Joel presented some examples of his workflow tools --- in particular, how he writes all his base text for papers, talks, etc., in markdown, then renders them out to the relevant forms (latex,revealjs slides, beamer pdf slides, etc.) 

Juan presented some tips for getting up and running with VSCode.
Relevant repositories:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Juan's example
- [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for Joel's example, along with
- [the gitlab directory](https://gitlab.com/darthoctopus/yale-software-club) for all the examples he showed (also includes the slides he presented).

## Session 2: 

## Session 3: Speeding up Python 

## Session 4: Website Development
The repo containing the example files for this session are [here](https://github.com/Astro-Examples/website-building). It contains both the index/css we were working on from scratch, along with the jekyll-fied example. You can also find the [slide deck](websites/jekyll.html) we presented.
